### Summary
This project aims to introduce us to the wonderful world of virtualization.  
We will create our first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if we can’t use VirtualBox) under specific instructions.  
Then, at the end of this project, we will be able to set up our own operating system while implementing strict rules.

### General guidelines
• The use of VirtualBox (or UTM if we can’t use VirtualBox) is mandatory.  
• We only have to turn in a signature.txt file at the root of the repository. We must paste in it the signature of our machine’s virtual disk.
